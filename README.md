## Summary
I build production-grade automation where **agentic workflows** are governed by **evaluation harnesses**, reinforced by **telemetry**, and constrained by **security guardrails**.

## What I work on
- **Agentic systems and orchestration**
  - stateful, multi-step workflows with governed tool-use
  - deterministic execution contracts: inputs, outputs, retries, fallbacks
  - checkpointing and resumability for long-running automation

- **Evals and reliability for AI systems**
  - regression suites that measure behaviour, not just passing tests
  - release gates tied to evals, error budgets, and rollback safety
  - feedback loops that turn telemetry into tighter control

- **Platform engineering**
  - secure-by-default foundations and repeatable delivery patterns
  - event-driven automation and control loops
  - end-to-end tracing for complex workflows (including GenAI components)

- **Applied security engineering**
  - identity-first design, segmentation, and blast-radius reduction
  - evidence-based controls and audit-friendly outputs

## Focus areas
- agentic workflows, orchestration, and runtime constraints
- evaluation-driven development and AI reliability engineering
- LLM observability: tracing, cost signals, latency, and behaviour metrics
- Azure-native architecture, identity, and operability
